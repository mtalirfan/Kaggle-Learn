You will define these values in the code cell below.\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/learn/images/FBoWr2f.png\" width=80%><br/>\n</center>\n    \n\nTo check your answer, we use your values to create a heuristic function as follows:\n\n```python\ndef get_heuristic_q1(grid, col, mark, config):\n    num_twos = count_windows(grid, 2, mark, config)\n    num_threes = count_windows(grid, 3, mark, config)\n    num_fours = count_windows(grid, 4, mark, config)\n    num_twos_opp = count_windows(grid, 2, mark%2+1, config)\n    num_threes_opp = count_windows(grid, 3, mark%2+1, config)\n    score = A*num_fours + B*num_threes + C*num_twos + D*num_twos_opp + E*num_threes_opp\n    return score\n```\n\nThis heuristic is then used to create an agent, that competes against the agent from the tutorial in 50 different game rounds.
